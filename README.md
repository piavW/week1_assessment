This is my file and code for the week_1_assessment, which was a mock tech-interview. 

Week 1 Assessment     
You have 20 minutes to complete the assessment. You can look wherever you want for help with your answers (Google, StackOverflow, course materials, etc.), as long asyou do not ask me (the coach) for help. 
Create a folder named ​week_1_assessment​ andadd a text file where you can write down your answers.     

As you work on this exercise, please 'think aloud.' That means verbally describing yourmental process as it develops, including the doubts and questions you have, thesolution strategies you consider, and the reasons that justify your decisions.Think Aloud Protocol      

The 'Think-aloud' protocol involve the participant thinking aloud as he or she areperforming a set of specified tasks or working on an excercise. The participant areasked to say whatever comes into his/her mind as she/he complete the task. This might include what he/she is looking at, thinking, doing, and feeling. This gives the coachvaluable insight into the participant's cognitive processes (rather than only their finalproduct), to make thought processes as explicit as possible during task performance.

Question 1 - VariablesCreate a variable and set it equal to ​'variable'​.What are some different data types? Write a few examples.

Question 2 - Hashes and ArraysOpen irb. We're going to make some cars. Create two hashes, one for each ​car​, with thefollowing attributes: ​wheels​, ​max_speed​, ​colorCreate an array that contains both cars.How do we use the array to access the second car? How do we find the second car'scolor​?

Question 3 - Classes and MethodsCreate a new folder called ​cars​ and inside of that folder, create a file called ​car.rb​ with:
●a class Car
●a method to "paint" a car a new color. Open irb. Load your 'car.rb' file. Create aninstance of a ​Car​ and change its color.

Question 4 - Rspec(Please use your text file to put your answers in)
●How do you initialize ​rspec​ in a folder? Do it in our cars folder.
●We would ordinarily have written our tests first, then written code to make them pass.Why?
●Create a unit test for our ​Car​ class to test our "painting" method.'
●A car should have a driver. Create an ​instance_double​​Driver​. Write a second test for this and make it pass.
